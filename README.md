# Drone Last-Mile Delivery Simulations

## Description

This repository holds the code for simulating drones along with trucks in last-mile delivery systems. 

1. We download real world map data and convert it to a network of relevant nodes and edges represeting paths and destinations.
2. Intialize basal path weights representing energy costs. Dynamic calculations are a functions of current state.
3. Intialize Drone and Truck Data structures for algorithm, getting most energy efficient iternary.

## 1. Getting Map Data & Creating Network

## 2. Weight Initialization

## 3. Algorithmic Simulation

## 4. Results Collection
